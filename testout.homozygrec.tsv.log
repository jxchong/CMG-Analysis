Requiring hits in gene in at least 1 subjects/families
Allowing up to 0 subjects per family to not have the correct genotype
Genotypes require at least 10 depth and at least 30 qual, otherwise genotype set to be missing
Missing genotypes/no calls are counted as: hit
Excluding all variants with annotations: intergenic
Only allow variants with GATK filter: PASS LowQual SBFilter SnpCluster QUALFilter QDFilter ABFilter HRunFilter
Excluding variants with MAF>.01 in ESP and/or 1000 Genomes
Excluding variants with frequency>=.2 in CMG subjects (likely systematic error)

Results summary:
In 2 gene(s), identified 2 variants
Total 22 variants in input
Total 22 variants from input examined after excluding 0:
	N=0 are systematic errors
	N=0 are common variants
	N=0 based on GATK filter
	N=0 based on functional annotation
Filtered out candidate hits from list of 2 variants matching inheritance model:
	N=0 variants excluded based on DP; N=0 variants based on GQ
	N=0 excluded because they were not unique within this dataset
